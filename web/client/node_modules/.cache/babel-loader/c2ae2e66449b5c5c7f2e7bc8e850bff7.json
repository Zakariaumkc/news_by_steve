influential Factory Records in the 1980s, is to launch a new label - convinced he has discovered his \\\"third major band\\\".\\n\\nFactory were the label of both Joy Division - who became New Order after singer Ian Curtis committed suicide - and the Happy Mondays. Now Wilson believes rap act Raw T - signed to his F4 label, the fourth incarnation of Factory - will \\\"complete the hat-trick\\\". \\\"Suddenly, when Raw T came into my life, I realised they are my third major band,\\\" he told BBC World Service\\'s The Music Biz programme. The group are set to release their first single on 21 February, and follow it up with an album, Realise And Witness, in March.\\n\\nWilson has twice tried to resurrect Factory - which lasted for 14 years before folding - but conceded these efforts had been 'despondent and dismal experience'. But it has not put him off. \\\"Of all the things I do in my life the most exciting thing I\\'ve ever done, and the thing I have most loved, is being part of a record company,\\\" he added.\\n\\n\\\"The idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life.\\\" Wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see Raw T, but he had initially been reluctant saying he \\\"detested\\\" young British people rapping. \\\"It\\'s always inauthentic, it\\'s always crass, it never really works for me,\\\" he said. \\\"I went to see this group, Raw T - which stands for Realise And Witness Talent - and like everyone else in the room that night, we were utterly blown away.\\\" Wilson believes Raw T could be \\\"to F4 as Joy Division were to Factory records\\\".\\n\\nThe story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.\\n\\nWilson stressed that the independent music scene remained \\\"as important\\\" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as Factory and Rough Trade proliferated. He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - \\\"perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium\\\" - were signed to indies. \\\"I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,\\\" he added. \\\"They can make more money that way - it\\'s a more generous relationship, and also it\\'s a more understanding relationship. \\\"I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.\\\"\\n'\"]]\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 184,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 183,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 179,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 178,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(GridItem, {\n        xs: 12,\n        sm: 12,\n        md: 6,\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Card, {\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardHeader, {\n            color: \"info\",\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h4\", {\n              className: classes.cardTitleWhite,\n              children: \"Super Size Me wins writers' award\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 199,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 198,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardBody, {\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Table, {\n              tableHeaderColor: \"info\",\n              tableData: [[\"'Ten-year tragedy of missing Manic\\n\\nRichey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist for The Manic Street Preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 February 1995. His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.\\n\\nFor his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band\\'s self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record\\'s artwork.\\n\\nAfter becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.\\n\\nEdwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band\\'s US tour to promote The Holy Bible. In the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, Graham and Sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.\\n\\nPolice discover Edwards\\' car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The rest of the band stop touring and recording.\\n\\nThe band play their first concerts since Edwards\\' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour.\\n\\nThe Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards\\' disappearance. A Design For Life reaches number two in the UK singles chart. The album Everything Must Go follows.\\n\\nThe Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards.\\n\\nA fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India. Interpol are alerted but do not track him down.\\n\\nGraham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son\\'s description has been seen in a bar called Underground. The report comes to nothing.\\n\\nEdwards\\' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. I'd just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we\\'d like him to come back - me, mum and dad, she said.\\n\\nThe band play a concert in the Cuban capital, Havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.\\n\\nOn the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards\\' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. They refuse. The Big Issue magazine, which supports homelessness charities, prints the last known picture of Edwards in a fresh plea for information.\\n\\nA pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the River Severn have no link to Edwards, police say.\\n\\nThe last song written by Edwards - a song called Judge Y\\'Self, which was to have been used for the Judge Dredd film soundtrack - is released on the B-side compilation Lipstick Traces. A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal.\\n\\nThe Manics\\' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.\\n\\nThe remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band\\'s royalties into an account held in his name.\\n\"]]\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 202,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 201,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 197,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 196,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(GridItem, {\n        xs: 12,\n        sm: 12,\n        md: 6,\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Card, {\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardHeader, {\n            color: \"info\",\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h4\", {\n              className: classes.cardTitleWhite,\n              children: \"Super Size Me wins writers' award\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 217,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 216,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardBody, {\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Table, {\n              tableHeaderColor: \"info\",\n              tableData: [[\"Super Size Me director Morgan Spurlock has won the Writers Guild of America's award for documentary feature writing. The Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonald's fast food for an entire month. Spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood on Tuesday. Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time. Producer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the film\\'s backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films. Spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but McDonald's for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered. The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonald\\'s announced it was to scrap its 'supersized' meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock's film.

The Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonald's fast food for an entire month. Spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood on Tuesday. Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time. Producer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the film\\'s backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films. Spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but McDonald's for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered. The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonald\\'s announced it was to scrap its 'supersized' meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock's film.

His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.\\n\\nFor his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band\\'s self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record\\'s artwork.\\n\\nAfter becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.\\n\\nEdwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band\\'s US tour to promote The Holy Bible. In the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, Graham and Sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.\\n\\nPolice discover Edwards\\' car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The rest of the band stop touring and recording.\\n\\nThe band play their first concerts since Edwards\\' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour.\\n\\nThe Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards\\' disappearance. A Design For Life reaches number two in the UK singles chart. The album Everything Must Go follows.\\n\\nThe Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards.\\n\\nA fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India. Interpol are alerted but do not track him down.\\n\\nGraham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son\\'s description has been seen in a bar called Underground. The report comes to nothing.\\n\\nEdwards\\' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. I'd just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we\\'d like him to come back - me, mum and dad, she said.\\n\\nThe band play a concert in the Cuban capital, Havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.\\n\\nOn the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards\\' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. They refuse. The Big Issue magazine, which supports homelessness charities, prints the last known picture of Edwards in a fresh plea for information.\\n\\nA pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the River Severn have no link to Edwards, police say.\\n\\nThe last song written by Edwards - a song called Judge Y\\'Self, which was to have been used for the Judge Dredd film soundtrack - is released on the B-side compilation Lipstick Traces. A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal.\\n\\nThe Manics\\' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.\\n\\nThe remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band\\'s royalties into an account held in his name.\\n\"]]\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 279,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 278,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 274,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 273,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(GridItem, {\n        xs: 12,\n        sm: 12,\n        md: 6,\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Card, {\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardHeader, {\n            color: \"info\",\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h4\", {\n              className: classes.cardTitleWhite,\n              children: \"Police praise 'courageous' Ozzy Rock star\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 294,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 293,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardBody, {\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Table, {\n              tableHeaderColor: \"info\",\n              tableData: [[\"b'Police praise \\'courageous\\' Ozzy\\n\\nRock star Ozzy Osbourne has been praised by police for \\\"very courageously\\\" tackling a burglar who stole jewellery from his house.\\n\\nThe singer grabbed an intruder who then jumped 30ft (10m) from a first floor window as the star gave chase at his Buckinghamshire home on Monday. \\\"I acted on impulse,\\\" Osbourne said. \\\"In hindsight, it could have been a lot worse.

Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window. \\\"Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house,\\\" he said. Ozzy said he was \\\"just coming to grips\\\" with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US.\\n\\n\\\"We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and I\\'m very disappointed.\\\" At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items. They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago. She said she wished she had worn them at night. \\\"I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that\\'s where they were, right beside me on my bedside table.\\\" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as \\\"one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure\\\".\\n\\nA daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen. She expressed her anger at the person who \\\"hasn\\'t worked and wants to take what\\'s yours\\\". \\\"But the thing is, we worked for everything. I came from Brixton. Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we\\'ve got we have worked our arses off for.\\\" \\\"If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that\\'s my business and I worked for every God damn penny.\\\" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife\\'s colon cancer, their childrens\\' drug problems and now the burglary.\\n\\nOn Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John\\'s partner David Furnish. Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5\\' 10\\\" tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers. They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window. There is no description of his accomplice.

The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP, the world\\'s biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.\\n\\nBut the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. \\\"The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,\\\" the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months.

EA publishes blockbuster titles such as Fifa and John Madden, as well as video game versions of movies such as Harry Potter and the James Bond films. Its revenues were $3bn (\\xc2\\xa31.65bn) in 2004, which EA hoped to double by 2009. EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. Nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the UK last year were published by EA.\\n\\nGerhard Florin, EA\\'s managing director for European publishing, said: \\\"Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science.\\\" He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (\\xc2\\xa316bn) - but it remained a goal for the company. \\\"We will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional.\\\" Mr Florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion.\\n\\n\\\"It\\'s the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesn\\'t really sell the emotion.\\n\\n\\\"With PS3 and Xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons,\\\" he said. \\\"With that increased firepower, the Finding Nemo video game looks just like the movie, but it will be interactive.\\\" Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA\\'s games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. \\\"Our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions.\\\" EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. \\\"Nobody queues for music anymore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can\\'t ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it,\\\" he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.\\n\\nJan Bolz, EA\\'s vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. \\\"One idea could be that you\\'re controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world \\'playing the show\\',\\\" said Mr Bolz.\\n\\nHe also said EA was planning an international awards show \\\"similar to the Oscars and the Grammys\\\" which would combine video games, music and movies. Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. \\\"People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them.\\\" Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s. \\\"There\\'s an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games. \\\"If that\\'s true, that\\'s a big challenge for TV broadcasters - because watching TV is the biggest pastime at present.\\\"\\n'\"]]\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 392,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 391,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 387,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 386,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(GridItem, {\n        xs: 12,\n        sm: 12,\n        md: 6,\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Card, {\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardHeader, {\n            color: \"info\",\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h4\", {\n              className: classes.cardTitleWhite,\n              children: \"The gaming world in 2005\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 407,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 406,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardBody, {\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Table, {\n              tableHeaderColor: \"info\",\n              tableData: [[\"If you have finished Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Halo 2, don't worry.

Solid, diverse, accessible and visually striking, it may well open up the genre like never before. If nothing else, it will develop a vast and loyal community. Released 25 February on PC. ICO 2 (WORKING TITLE) Ico remains a benchmark for PS2 gaming, a title that took players into a uniquely atmospheric and artistic world of adventure. The (spiritual) sequel has visuals that echo those of the original, but promises to expand the Ico world, with hero Wanda taking on a series of giants. The other known working title is Wanda And Colossus. Release date to be confirmed on PS2. THE LEGEND OF ZELDA \\n\\nThe charismatic cel imagery has been scrapped in favour of a dark, detailed aesthetic (realism isn't quite the right word) that connects more with Ocarina Of Time. Link resumes his more teenage incarnation too, though enemies, elements and moves look familiar from the impressive trailer that has been released. Horseback adventuring across a vast land is promised. Release date to be confirmed on GameCube. ADVANCE WARS DS The UK Nintendo DS launch line-up is still to be confirmed at time of writing, but titles that exploit its two-screen and touch capacity, like WarioWare Touched! and Sega's Feel The Magic, are making a strong impression in other territories.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. \\n\\nFollowing in the high-spec footsteps of Far Cry and Half-Life 2, this looks like the key upcoming PC first-person shooter (with role-playing elements). The fact that it is inspired in part by Andrei Tarkovsky's enigmatic 1979 masterpiece Stalker and set in 2012 in the disaster zone, a world of decay and mutation, makes it all the more intriguing. Released 1 March on PC. METAL GEAR SOLID: SNAKE EATER \\n\\nMore Hideo Kojima serious stealth, featuring action in the Soviet-controlled jungle in 1964. The game see Snake having to survive on his wits in the jungle, including eating wildlife. Once again, expect cinematic cut scenes and polished production values. Released March on PS2. DEAD OR ALIVE ULTIMATE Tecmo's Team Ninja are back with retooled and revamped versions of Dead Or Alive 1 and 2. Here's the big, big deal though - they're playable over Xbox Live. Released 11 March on Xbox.

his \\\"third major band\\\".\\n\\nFactory were the label of both Joy Division - who became New Order after singer Ian Curtis committed suicide - and the Happy Mondays. Now Wilson believes rap act Raw T - signed to his F4 label, the fourth incarnation of Factory - will \\\"complete the hat-trick\\\". \\\"Suddenly, when Raw T came into my life, I realised they are my third major band,\\\" he told BBC World Service\\'s The Music Biz programme. The group are set to release their first single on 21 February, and follow it up with an album, Realise And Witness, in March.\\n\\nWilson has twice tried to resurrect Factory - which lasted for 14 years before folding - but conceded these efforts had been 'despondent and dismal experience'. But it has not put him off. \\\"Of all the things I do in my life the most exciting thing I\\'ve ever done, and the thing I have most loved, is being part of a record company,\\\" he added.\\n\\n\\\"The idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life.\\\" Wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see Raw T, but he had initially been reluctant saying he \\\"detested\\\" young British people rapping. \\\"It\\'s always inauthentic, it\\'s always crass, it never really works for me,\\\" he said. \\\"I went to see this group, Raw T - which stands for Realise And Witness Talent - and like everyone else in the room that night, we were utterly blown away.\\\" Wilson believes Raw T could be \\\"to F4 as Joy Division were to Factory records\\\".\\n\\nThe story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.\\n\\nWilson stressed that the independent music scene remained \\\"as important\\\" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as Factory and Rough Trade proliferated. He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - \\\"perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium\\\" - were signed to indies. \\\"I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,\\\" he added. \\\"They can make more money that way - it\\'s a more generous relationship, and also it\\'s a more understanding relationship. \\\"I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.\\\"\\n'\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n\n        <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>\n          <Card>\n            <CardHeader color=\"info\">\n              <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>Super Size Me wins writers' award</h4>\n            </CardHeader>\n            <CardBody>\n              <Table\n                tableHeaderColor=\"info\"\n                tableData={[\n                  [\n                    \"'Ten-year tragedy of missing Manic\\n\\nRichey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist for The Manic Street Preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 February 1995.

They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago. She said she wished she had worn them at night. \\\"I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that\\'s where they were, right beside me on my bedside table.\\\" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as \\\"one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure\\\".\\n\\nA daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen. She expressed her anger at the person who \\\"hasn\\'t worked and wants to take what\\'s yours\\\". \\\"But the thing is, we worked for everything. I came from Brixton. Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we\\'ve got we have worked our arses off for.\\\" \\\"If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that\\'s my business and I worked for every God damn penny.\\\" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife\\'s colon cancer, their childrens\\' drug problems and now the burglary.\\n\\nOn Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John\\'s partner David Furnish. Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5\\' 10\\\" tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers. They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window. There is no description of his accomplice. Police think the pair were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at speed. Police appealed for public help to find the perpetrators and stolen items on 0845 8 505 505 or 0800 555 111.\\n'\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n\n        <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>\n          <Card>\n            <CardHeader color=\"info\">\n              <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>Eastwood's Baby scoops top Oscars</h4>\n            </CardHeader>\n            <CardBody>\n              <Table\n                tableHeaderColor=\"info\"\n                tableData={[\n                  [\n                    \"\\n\\nClint Eastwood\\'s Million Dollar Baby beat Martin Scorsese\\'s The Aviator to the top awards at the Oscars on Sunday.\\n\\nThe boxing drama was named best picture and Eastwood pipped Scorsese to best director, while its stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won acting awards.

And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \\\"beautiful legacy\\\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \\\"You took a chance, man,\\\" he said. \\\"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \\\"Everybody\\'s drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\\\"\\n\\nHe broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young.

That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA\\'s own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December\\'s bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year.\\n\\nEven though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles. People are using SMS to do much more too. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee\\'s (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting \\\"Donate\\\" to a simple short code number. Looking further ahead in the year, the MDA\\'s chairman Mike Short, has predicted that more people will go online through their mobiles, estimating 15 billion WAP page impressions. Handsets with GPRS capability - an \\\"always on\\\" net connection - will rise to 75%, while 3G mobile ownership growing to five million by the end of 2005. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.\\n'\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n\n        <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>\n          <Card>\n            <CardHeader color=\"info\">\n              <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>US woman sues over ink cartridges</h4>\n            </CardHeader>\n            <CardBody>\n              <Table\n                tableHeaderColor=\"info\"\n                tableData={[\n                  [\n                    \"\\n\\nA US woman is suing Hewlett Packard (HP), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.\\n\\nThe unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP, the world\\'s biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.\\n\\nBut the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. \\\"The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,\\\" the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months. The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as \\xc2\\xa334 but it could cost up to \\xc2\\xa31,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year. The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UK\\'s Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.\\n'\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n\n        <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>\n          <Card>\n            <CardHeader color=\"info\">\n              <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>EA to take on film and TV giants</h4>\n            </CardHeader>\n            <CardBody>\n              <Table\n                tableHeaderColor=\"info\"\n                tableData={[\n                  [\n                    \"\\n\\nVideo game giant Electronic Arts (EA) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world.\\n\\nThe US firm says it wants to compete with companies such as Disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences. EA publishes blockbuster titles such as Fifa and John Madden, as well as video game versions of movies such as Harry Potter and the James Bond films. Its revenues were $3bn (\\xc2\\xa31.65bn) in 2004, which EA hoped to double by 2009. EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. Nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the UK last year were published by EA.\\n\\nGerhard Florin, EA\\'s managing director for European publishing, said: \\\"Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science.\\\" He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (\\xc2\\xa316bn) - but it remained a goal for the company. \\\"We will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional.\\\" Mr Florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion.\\n\\n\\\"It\\'s the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesn\\'t really sell the emotion.\\n\\n\\\"With PS3 and Xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons,\\\" he said. \\\"With that increased firepower, the Finding Nemo video game looks just like the movie, but it will be interactive.\\\" Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA\\'s games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. \\\"Our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions.\\\" EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. \\\"Nobody queues for music anymore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can\\'t ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it,\\\" he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.\\n\\nJan Bolz, EA\\'s vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. \\\"One idea could be that you\\'re controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world \\'playing the show\\',\\\" said Mr Bolz.\\n\\nHe also said EA was planning an international awards show \\\"similar to the Oscars and the Grammys\\\" which would combine video games, music and movies. Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. \\\"People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them.\\\" Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s. \\\"There\\'s an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games. \\\"If that\\'s true, that\\'s a big challenge for TV broadcasters - because watching TV is the biggest pastime at present.\\\"\\n'\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n\n        <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>\n          <Card>\n            <CardHeader color=\"info\">\n              <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>The gaming world in 2005</h4>\n            </CardHeader>\n            <CardBody>\n              <Table\n                tableHeaderColor=\"info\"\n                tableData={[\n                  [\n                    \"If you have finished Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Halo 2, don't worry.

Solid, diverse, accessible and visually striking, it may well open up the genre like never before. If nothing else, it will develop a vast and loyal community. Released 25 February on PC. ICO 2 (WORKING TITLE) Ico remains a benchmark for PS2 gaming, a title that took players into a uniquely atmospheric and artistic world of adventure. The (spiritual) sequel has visuals that echo those of the original, but promises to expand the Ico world, with hero Wanda taking on a series of giants. The other known working title is Wanda And Colossus. Release date to be confirmed on PS2. THE LEGEND OF ZELDA \\n\\nThe charismatic cel imagery has been scrapped in favour of a dark, detailed aesthetic (realism isn't quite the right word) that connects more with Ocarina Of Time. Link resumes his more teenage incarnation too, though enemies, elements and moves look familiar from the impressive trailer that has been released. Horseback adventuring across a vast land is promised. Release date to be confirmed on GameCube. ADVANCE WARS DS The UK Nintendo DS launch line-up is still to be confirmed at time of writing, but titles that exploit its two-screen and touch capacity, like WarioWare Touched! and Sega's Feel The Magic, are making a strong impression in other territories. Personally, I can't wait for the latest Advance Wars, the franchise that has been the icing on the cake of Nintendo handheld gaming during the past few years. Release date to be confirmed on DS. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. \\n\\nFollowing in the high-spec footsteps of Far Cry and Half-Life 2, this looks like the key upcoming PC first-person shooter (with role-playing elements). The fact that it is inspired in part by Andrei Tarkovsky's enigmatic 1979 masterpiece Stalker and set in 2012 in the disaster zone, a world of decay and mutation, makes it all the more intriguing. Released 1 March on PC. METAL GEAR SOLID: SNAKE EATER \\n\\nMore Hideo Kojima serious stealth, featuring action in the Soviet-controlled jungle in 1964. The game see Snake having to survive on his wits in the jungle, including eating wildlife. Once again, expect cinematic cut scenes and polished production values. Released March on PS2. DEAD OR ALIVE ULTIMATE Tecmo's Team Ninja are back with retooled and revamped versions of Dead Or Alive 1 and 2. Here's the big, big deal though - they're playable over Xbox Live. Released 11 March on Xbox. KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC II Looks set to build on the acclaimed original Star Wars role playing game with new characters, new Force powers and a new set of moral decisions, despite a different developer. Released 11 February on Xbox and PC.\\n\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n      </GridContainer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
