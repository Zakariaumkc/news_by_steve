The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonald\\'s announced it was to scrap its 'supersized' meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock's film. Spurlock was given his award on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled that two UK activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a McDonald's libel action. Helen Steel and David Morris, from north London, dubbed the 'McLibel Two', were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out At the end of the case the High Court in London ruled McDonald\\'s had been libelled and awarded the company \\xc2\\xa360,000 in damages, later reduced to \\xc2\\xa340,000 on appeal.

His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.\\n\\nFor his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band\\'s self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record\\'s artwork.\\n\\nAfter becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.\\n\\nEdwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band\\'s US tour to promote The Holy Bible. In the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, Graham and Sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.\\n\\nPolice discover Edwards\\' car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The rest of the band stop touring and recording.\\n\\nThe band play their first concerts since Edwards\\' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour.\\n\\nThe Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards\\' disappearance. A Design For Life reaches number two in the UK singles chart. The album Everything Must Go follows.\\n\\nThe Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards.\\n\\nA fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India. Interpol are alerted but do not track him down.\\n\\nGraham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son\\'s description has been seen in a bar called Underground. The report comes to nothing.\\n\\nEdwards\\' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. I'd just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we\\'d like him to come back - me, mum and dad, she said.\\n\\nThe band play a concert in the Cuban capital, Havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.\\n\\nOn the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards\\' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. They refuse. The Big Issue magazine, which supports homelessness charities, prints the last known picture of Edwards in a fresh plea for information.\\n\\nA pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the River Severn have no link to Edwards, police say.\\n\\nThe last song written by Edwards - a song called Judge Y\\'Self, which was to have been used for the Judge Dredd film soundtrack - is released on the B-side compilation Lipstick Traces. A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal.\\n\\nThe Manics\\' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.\\n\\nThe remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band\\'s royalties into an account held in his name.\\n\"]]\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 202,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 201,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 197,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 196,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(GridItem, {\n        xs: 12,\n        sm: 12,\n        md: 6,\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Card, {\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardHeader, {\n            color: \"info\",\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h4\", {\n              className: classes.cardTitleWhite,\n              children: \"Super Size Me wins writers' award\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 217,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 216,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardBody, {\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Table, {\n              tableHeaderColor: \"info\",\n              tableData: [[\"Super Size Me director Morgan Spurlock has won the Writers Guild of America's award for documentary feature writing.

His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.\\n\\nFor his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band\\'s self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record\\'s artwork.\\n\\nAfter becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.\\n\\nEdwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band\\'s US tour to promote The Holy Bible. In the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, Graham and Sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.\\n\\nPolice discover Edwards\\' car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The rest of the band stop touring and recording.\\n\\nThe band play their first concerts since Edwards\\' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour.\\n\\nThe Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards\\' disappearance. A Design For Life reaches number two in the UK singles chart. The album Everything Must Go follows.\\n\\nThe Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards.\\n\\nA fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India. Interpol are alerted but do not track him down.\\n\\nGraham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son\\'s description has been seen in a bar called Underground. The report comes to nothing.\\n\\nEdwards\\' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. I'd just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we\\'d like him to come back - me, mum and dad, she said.\\n\\nThe band play a concert in the Cuban capital, Havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.\\n\\nOn the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards\\' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. They refuse. The Big Issue magazine, which supports homelessness charities, prints the last known picture of Edwards in a fresh plea for information.\\n\\nA pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the River Severn have no link to Edwards, police say.\\n\\nThe last song written by Edwards - a song called Judge Y\\'Self, which was to have been used for the Judge Dredd film soundtrack - is released on the B-side compilation Lipstick Traces. A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal.\\n\\nThe Manics\\' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.\\n\\nThe remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band\\'s royalties into an account held in his name.\\n\"]]\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 279,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 278,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 274,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 273,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(GridItem, {\n        xs: 12,\n        sm: 12,\n        md: 6,\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Card, {\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardHeader, {\n            color: \"info\",\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h4\", {\n              className: classes.cardTitleWhite,\n              children: \"Police praise 'courageous' Ozzy\\\\n\\\\nRock star\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 294,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 293,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(CardBody, {\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Table, {\n              tableHeaderColor: \"info\",\n              tableData: [[\"b'Police praise \\'courageous\\' Ozzy\\n\\nRock star Ozzy Osbourne has been praised by police for \\\"very courageously\\\" tackling a burglar who stole jewellery from his house.\\n\\nThe singer grabbed an intruder who then jumped 30ft (10m) from a first floor window as the star gave chase at his Buckinghamshire home on Monday. \\\"I acted on impulse,\\\" Osbourne said. \\\"In hindsight, it could have been a lot worse.

His wife Sharon, who called the police, said her wedding rings were taken from her bedside table as she slept.\\n\\nThe heavy metal star said he could have met the same fate as late Beatle George Harrison, who was repeatedly stabbed in a break-in in 1999. \\\"I could have been badly injured or shot or anything,\\\" Osbourne said. \\\"I just thank God that no-one got injured.\\\" He added he was glad the intruders were not hurt. \\\"I wouldn\\'t want anyone to get injured.\\\" The singer did not want to talk in detail about his actions but when asked whether he would do the same again replied: \\\"Is the Pope a Catholic?\\\" The incident happened at 0400 GMT on Monday in Chalfont St Peter. Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window. \\\"Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house,\\\" he said. Ozzy said he was \\\"just coming to grips\\\" with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US.\\n\\n\\\"We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and I\\'m very disappointed.\\\" At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items. They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago. She said she wished she had worn them at night. \\\"I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that\\'s where they were, right beside me on my bedside table.\\\" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as \\\"one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure\\\".\\n\\nA daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen. She expressed her anger at the person who \\\"hasn\\'t worked and wants to take what\\'s yours\\\". \\\"But the thing is, we worked for everything. I came from Brixton. Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we\\'ve got we have worked our arses off for.\\\" \\\"If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that\\'s my business and I worked for every God damn penny.\\\" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife\\'s colon cancer, their childrens\\' drug problems and now the burglary.\\n\\nOn Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John\\'s partner David Furnish. Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5\\' 10\\\" tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers. They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window. There is no description of his accomplice. Police think the pair were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at speed.

Now Wilson believes rap act Raw T - signed to his F4 label, the fourth incarnation of Factory - will \\\"complete the hat-trick\\\". \\\"Suddenly, when Raw T came into my life, I realised they are my third major band,\\\" he told BBC World Service\\'s The Music Biz programme. The group are set to release their first single on 21 February, and follow it up with an album, Realise And Witness, in March.\\n\\nWilson has twice tried to resurrect Factory - which lasted for 14 years before folding - but conceded these efforts had been 'despondent and dismal experience'. But it has not put him off. \\\"Of all the things I do in my life the most exciting thing I\\'ve ever done, and the thing I have most loved, is being part of a record company,\\\" he added.\\n\\n\\\"The idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life.\\\" Wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see Raw T, but he had initially been reluctant saying he \\\"detested\\\" young British people rapping. \\\"It\\'s always inauthentic, it\\'s always crass, it never really works for me,\\\" he said. \\\"I went to see this group, Raw T - which stands for Realise And Witness Talent - and like everyone else in the room that night, we were utterly blown away.\\\" Wilson believes Raw T could be \\\"to F4 as Joy Division were to Factory records\\\".\\n\\nThe story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.\\n\\nWilson stressed that the independent music scene remained \\\"as important\\\" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as Factory and Rough Trade proliferated. He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - \\\"perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium\\\" - were signed to indies. \\\"I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,\\\" he added. \\\"They can make more money that way - it\\'s a more generous relationship, and also it\\'s a more understanding relationship. \\\"I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.\\\"\\n'\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n\n        <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>\n          <Card>\n            <CardHeader color=\"info\">\n              <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>Super Size Me wins writers' award</h4>\n            </CardHeader>\n            <CardBody>\n              <Table\n                tableHeaderColor=\"info\"\n                tableData={[\n                  [\n                    \"'Ten-year tragedy of missing Manic\\n\\nRichey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist for The Manic Street Preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 February 1995.

His wife Sharon, who called the police, said her wedding rings were taken from her bedside table as she slept.\\n\\nThe heavy metal star said he could have met the same fate as late Beatle George Harrison, who was repeatedly stabbed in a break-in in 1999. \\\"I could have been badly injured or shot or anything,\\\" Osbourne said. \\\"I just thank God that no-one got injured.\\\" He added he was glad the intruders were not hurt. \\\"I wouldn\\'t want anyone to get injured.\\\" The singer did not want to talk in detail about his actions but when asked whether he would do the same again replied: \\\"Is the Pope a Catholic?\\\" The incident happened at 0400 GMT on Monday in Chalfont St Peter. Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window. \\\"Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house,\\\" he said. Ozzy said he was \\\"just coming to grips\\\" with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US.\\n\\n\\\"We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and I\\'m very disappointed.\\\" At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items. They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago. She said she wished she had worn them at night. \\\"I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that\\'s where they were, right beside me on my bedside table.\\\" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as \\\"one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure\\\".\\n\\nA daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen. She expressed her anger at the person who \\\"hasn\\'t worked and wants to take what\\'s yours\\\". \\\"But the thing is, we worked for everything. I came from Brixton. Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we\\'ve got we have worked our arses off for.\\\" \\\"If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that\\'s my business and I worked for every God damn penny.\\\" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife\\'s colon cancer, their childrens\\' drug problems and now the burglary.\\n\\nOn Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John\\'s partner David Furnish. Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5\\' 10\\\" tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers. They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window. There is no description of his accomplice. Police think the pair were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at speed.

Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time. Producer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the film\\'s backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films. Spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but McDonald's for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered. The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonald\\'s announced it was to scrap its 'supersized' meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock's film. Spurlock was given his award on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled that two UK activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a McDonald's libel action. Helen Steel and David Morris, from north London, dubbed the 'McLibel Two', were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out At the end of the case the High Court in London ruled McDonald\\'s had been libelled and awarded the company \\xc2\\xa360,000 in damages, later reduced to \\xc2\\xa340,000 on appeal. But he found the leaflet was true in some aspects.\",\n                  ],\n                ]}\n              />\n            </CardBody>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n      </GridContainer>\n\n      <GridContainer>\n        <GridItem xs={12} sm={6} md={3}>\n          <Card>\n            <CardHeader color=\"info\" stats icon>\n              <CardIcon color=\"info\">\n                <Icon>info_outline</Icon>\n              </CardIcon>\n              <h3 className={classes.cardTitle}>Tech</h3>\n            </CardHeader>\n            <CardFooter stats>\n              <div className={classes.stats}>\n                <Update />\n                <a href=\"#pablo\" onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}>\n                  Just Updated\n                </a>\n              </div>\n            </CardFooter>\n          </Card>\n        </GridItem>\n      </GridContainer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
